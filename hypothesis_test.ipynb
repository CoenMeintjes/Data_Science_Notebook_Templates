    "    - Compares a sample mean or proportion to a known population mean or proportion. This type of test is used when we want to know whether a sample is statistically different from a population, or if an intervention or treatment has a significant effect on a population. For example, a one-sample t-test can be used to determine if the average weight of a sample of apples is different from a known population mean weight.\n",
    "- Two-Sample\n",
    "    - Compares two sample means or proportions to each other. This type of test is used when we want to compare two groups to see if there is a statistically significant difference between them. For example, a two-sample t-test can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average test scores between two different classes of students.\n",
    "- T-test\n",
    "    - t-tests are used when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small (typically, a sample size less than 30). The test statistic for a t-test is calculated using the t-distribution, which takes into account the added uncertainty that comes with estimating the population variance from a small sample. The t-test is more robust than the z-test in situations where the population variance is unknown, and it is more likely to produce reliable results with small sample sizes.\n",
    "- Z-test\n",
    "    - Used when the population variance is known, or when the sample size is large (typically, a sample size greater than 30). The test statistic for a z-test is calculated using the standard normal distribution, and the null hypothesis is tested against a standard normal distribution. The z-test is useful when the population variance is known, as it provides a more precise estimate of the true population mean."
