# Data Science Jupyter Notebook Templates

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook templates for data science tasks such as hypothesis tests, regression models, and machine learning models. These templates are designed to help data scientists and analysts quickly and easily create and execute common data analysis tasks using Python.

## Getting Started
To use these notebook templates, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the following links:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-science-notebook-templates.git```

## Notebook Templates
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook templates:

- **Basic Hypothesis Testing Template:** This template provides a starting point for conducting hypothesis tests on data using Python. It includes code for calculating statistical z-tests and t-tests and provides examples of how to interpret the results.

- **Simple Linear Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for building simple linear regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Multiple Regression Analysis Template:** This template provides a starting point for building multiple regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Binomial Logistic Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for the creation of a binomial logistic regression model in Python. It includes code for importing data, doing exploratory data analysis, constructing the regression model and evaluating the model performance.  

***Coming Soon***
- **Machine Learning Templates:** These templates will offer a starting point for building machine learning models in Python. It will include code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a machine learning model, and evaluating the model's performance.
