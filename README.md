## Getting Started
To use these notebook templates, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the following links:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-science-notebook-templates.git```

## Notebook Templates
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook templates:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Template:** This template provides a framework for the exploratory data analysis process. It includes code for Discovering, Structuring, Cleaning, Joining, Validating and Presenting data.

- **Basic Hypothesis Testing Template:** This template provides a starting point for conducting hypothesis tests on data using Python. It includes code for calculating statistical z-tests and t-tests and provides examples of how to interpret the results.

- **Simple Linear Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for building simple linear regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Multiple Regression Analysis Template:** This template provides a starting point for building multiple regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Binomial Logistic Regression Template:** This template provides a starting point for the creation of a binomial logistic regression model in Python. It includes code for importing data, doing exploratory data analysis, constructing the regression model and evaluating the model performance.  

- **Naive Bayes Classification Model:** This template provides a starting point for the construction of a Naive Bayes model in Python. The template includes code for loading relevant packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing the model and evaluating the results.

- **K-means Template:** This template provides a starting point for the construction of a k-mean partitioning model in Python. The notebook includes code for importing libraries, importing data, doing exploratory data analysis, constructing the k-means model and evaluating the model performance.

- **Decision Tree Template:** This notebook template provides a starting point for the construction of a Decision Tree model in Python. The notebook includes code for loading packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing and evaluating the model.

- **Random Forest Template:** This notebook template provides a starting point for the construction of a Random Forest classification model in Python. The notebook includes code for loading packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing and evaluating the model.

- **Gradient Boost Template:** This notebook template provides a starting point for the construction of a Gradient Boost classification model in Python. The notebook includes code for loading packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing and evaluating the model.

- **Project Notebook:** This notebook provides a project notebook template that is used to improve logical workflow.

- **Model Evaluation:** This notebook provides useful functions that follow the workflow of a train, validate, test model development process. The functions make it easy to view model results at any stage of the process as well as aggregate results into a dataframe for model comparison.
