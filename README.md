## Getting Started
To use these notebook templates, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the following links:

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook

Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-science-notebook-templates.git```

## Notebook Templates
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook templates:

- **Basic Hypothesis Testing Template:** This template provides a starting point for conducting hypothesis tests on data using Python. It includes code for calculating statistical z-tests and t-tests and provides examples of how to interpret the results.

- ***Coming Soon***
- **Regression Analysis Template:** This template will provide a starting point for building regression models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a regression model, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Machine Learning Template:** This template will a starting point for building machine learning models in Python. It includes code for importing data, preprocessing the data, building a machine learning model, and evaluating the model's performance.
